# Excel Retail Sales Analysis

## Dataset Background
The dataset used in this project was acquired from the website, excelbianalytics.com. It contains 5000 unique records of sales data over 8 years for an international retailer.

## Description
Minor data cleaning still had to be carried out although the data was well-structured. Necessary abbreviation expansion was carried out, new columns were also included in the dataset using excel functions; ‘Order month’, ‘Order year’ and ‘Order lead time’ which would help with analysis on the data. 

Pivot tables to handle aggregated measures across various fields were employed for efficient data analysis, visually appealing charts that best represent the data and accurately depict the underlying data trends were generated. Building upon this, a comprehensive dashboard was carefully crafted to provide an all-inclusive view of the information.

#### Note that the dataset is fictitious, they are not real sales data but rather generated through random logic in VBA. It is also recommended that the file is viewed with MS Excel due to some elements’ format in the dashboard.
